## Welcome to this course

Welcome to this course on crime mapping! This course uses interactive tutorials like this one to help you learn about using maps and spatial analysis techniques to understand crime. Watch this video to learn more about the course.

## Why put crimes on maps?

This course is about how we can use maps and other spatial analysis tools to help understand, prevent and respond to crime. Watch this video to understand why spatial analysis is a useful tool for understanding crime.

## Why is crime concentrated in space?

Why is crime concentrated in space? Watch this video to find out more about how our environment influences opportunities for crime and how that causes clusters of different crimes.

```{r why-concentrated-quiz}
quiz(
  caption = "",
  question(
    "What are the three 'almost always' elements of an opportunity for a crime to occur that are outlined in the routine activities apporach?",
    answer("offender, target, place", correct = TRUE),
    answer("means, motive, opportunity", message = "It looks like you've watched lots of police dramas, but maybe not the video here! Try watching the video again and think about the elements of the routine activities approach."),
    answer("offender, victim, place", message = "While many crimes have a victim, the routine activities apporach focuses on the interaction between the offender and the *target*. Sometimes (e.g. in an assault) the target will be the victim, but in others (e.g. a burglary) the target that the offender is interested in might be separte from the victim."),
    answer("offender, target, opportunity", message = "The three 'almost always' elements make up an opportunity for crime, but opportunity is not one of the three elements."),

## Finding your way around RStudio

We will use RStudio for almost all of this course. Watch this video to find your way around the different panels in the RStudio window.

![](https://youtu.be/6bonySXb2_g)


### Slightly adjusting how RStudio works

Before we start using RStudio, we should make a few changes to how it is set up that will make it easier to fix any mistakes we make while coding. To do this, click on the `Tools` menu in RStudio and then on `Global Options…`. In the dialogue box that opens, click on `General` in the left-hand panel if `General` is not selected already.

<p class="centered-image"><img src="images/workspace_options.png" alt="A screen shot of the RStudio Global Options dialogue box, showing which options should be selected."></p>

In the "Workspace" section of the right-hand panel, find an option that says "Restore .RData into workspace at startup" and make sure the check box to the left of that option is **not checked**. On the next line down, click the drop-down menu labelled "Save workspace to .RData on exit:" and choose the option **Never**. Click `Apply` and then `OK` to close the dialogue box.

The [RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/rstudio-ide.pdf) highlights some of the features available in RStudio and gives a list of available keyboard short-cuts.

[Writing Code in RStudio](https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/programming-part-1-writing-code-in-rstudio/) is a webinar that talks you through RStudio in more detail.

## In summary

Now that you know why crime mapping is useful for understanding crime, why crime is typically concentrated in space and how to find your way around RStudio, in the next tutorial we will produce our first crime map in R.

If you're not feeling too confident at this point in the course, don't worry – learning something new is always a bit of a roller coaster and there is lots of help available in subsequent tutorials.
