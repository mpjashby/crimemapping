## Map choices

Among the most important decisions you make when you are creating a map is what
information to include and what to leave out. Watch this video to learn more 
about why this is important and how you can make those decisions.

![](https://youtu.be/2_YOwOmodG0)

The most important thing to remember when designing a map is to keep in mind the
purpose that the map will be used for. Research on how people use maps has 
repeatedly shown that "[the nature of the task or function to be performed by the 
map user is the single most important factor in determining how [someone] 
processes the information on the map](https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315736822.ch3)".

As explained in the video, when you create a crime map you should ask yourself:

  * *How much does my audience know about this topic?* so that you know how much
    information you should provide to help them understand it.
  * *How well does my audience know this geographic area?* so that you know what
    information to include to help people orient themselves, e.g. landmarks,
    main roads of natural features such as rivers.
  * *What will my audience use this map for?* so that you can make sure 
    everything on your map is relevant to that goal.
  * *In what context will they be using this map?* so that you can make the
    format of the map suitable to that context (e.g. if the map is going to be
    viewed by a large audience in a lecture hall, or by a police officer on 
    their phone at night).
  * *What biases or opinions about this topic might my audience have?* so that
    you can consider how the information (and your presentation of it) might
    influence those opinions or biases one way or another.
    
Maps are powerful communication tools, which can sometimes knowingly or 
unknowingly mislead the reader. Watch this video to learn more about how maps
can be misleading.

![](https://youtu.be/G0_MBrJnRq0)

Whenever you make a map, think about your own biases -- are your own views on a
topic likely to influence the results of your analysis? One way to test your
own assumptions about a topic is to test them against other potential
assumptions using an approach to crime analysis called hypothesis testing. To
find out more about the hypothesis testing approach, read the paper 
[*Improving the explanatory content of analysis products using hypothesis testing*](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1012.6309&rep=rep1&type=pdf)



## Visual hierarchy

Maps are among the most complex types of data visualisation. Even if we have
chosen wisely what to include and what to leave out, there is likely to be lots 
of information on our map. For all but the simplest maps, there is a risk of
readers -- especially those in a hurry -- might be overwhelmed or mislead by
competing pieces of information (such as different layers of data) on a map.

To help readers understand what parts of a map they should focus most of their
attention on and which are of less importance, we can establish a visual
hierarchy. Watch this video to learn more about visual hierarchies in mapping.

![](https://youtu.be/ezz_SPl0Xr4)

We have used some of the principles of visual hierarchy in the maps we
have already made. For example, in the density map of bike thefts in Vancouver,
we used strong colours to represent the data and shades of grey for the base
map. This helped readers intuitively understand that they should focus most
attention on the data.



## Supporting elements

We can often make our maps much more useful by adding supporting elements that
explain the map content, give context or provide extra information. Watch this
video to find out what elements you can add to your maps to make them more
useful.

![](https://youtu.be/uXUeb-qmgTc)

We will not need to include every supporting element mentioned in the video in
all the maps we make. The visual hierarchy that you establish in your map by use
of size, colour, etc. should make it clear which elements are most important. The
data should always come first in the visual hierarchy, usually followed by the
title and then the legend. Other elements should be lower down the hierarchy. 
In every map, the supporting elements should be designed so that they do not 
distract from the data.

```{r hierarchy-table}
tribble(
  ~"place in hierarchy", ~"map element", ~"how often needed",
  "1st", "data layers", "always",
  "2nd", "title", "virtually always",
  "3rd", "legend", "usually",
  "4th", "base map", "almost always",
  "5th", "author and date", "virtually always",
  "=6th", "scale", "sometimes",
  "=6th", "north arrow", "sometimes",
  "7th", "grid",  "rarely"
) %>% 
  knitr::kable(align = "rl", caption = "Visual hierarchy of elements in a crime map")
```

Elements that are almost always needed on a crime map are not necessarily 
highest on the visual hierarchy. For example, the author name is virtually
always needed but is relatively low on the visual hierarchy. This is because it
is important information for readers who need it to judge the reliability of a
map, or to get in touch to ask questions, but should not distract from the data
for those readers who do not need it.



## Creating and storing a map

Since we will be adding various elements to a map in this tutorial, we will 
first create a map and save it as an R object. Any map or chart produced using
the `ggplot()` function can be saved as an object using the assignment operator
`<-`. Just as for the result of any other R function, if we save it to an object
the result will not be printed to the screen, but we can easily see the plot by
simply typing the object name in the R console.

We will use a map of shootings in the Bronx borough of New York City in 2019 as
the map to which we will add the supporting map elements. This map does not 
include a base map, but this is only to slightly speed up how this tutorial runs
on computers with slower internet connections -- all the code in this tutorial
is compatible with maps that include a base map.

```{r title-exercise1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=49, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Load packages
library(ggmap)
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)

# Load shootings data
shootings <- read_csv("https://github.com/mpjashby/crimemapping/raw/main/inst/extdata/bronx_shootings.csv")

# Load NYC police precincts data

  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  # filter just those precincts that are in the Bronx (40th to 52nd)
  filter(precinct %in% 40:52)

# Load a base map
base_map <- shootings %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326, remove = FALSE) %>%
  st_bbox() %>%
  set_names(c("left", "bottom", "right", "top")) %>%
  get_stamenmap(zoom = 13)

# Create map object

    aes(x = longitude, y = latitude),
    data = shootings,

    adjust = 0.5,
    alpha = 0.7,
    na.rm = TRUE
  ) +

    lineheight = 0.9, 
    size = 2.5, 
    label.size = NA, 
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PuBu") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# Display map
shootings_map
```

<a href="https://scales.r-lib.org" title="scales website"><img src="images/scales.png" class="right-side-image"></a>

The code used to create this map is very similar to the code we used in one of
the previous tutorials to make a map of bike theft in Vancouver. The only 
difference (except the lack of a base map) is that we have used the `ordinal()`
function from the [`scales` package](https://scales.r-lib.org) to convert
the precinct numbers to ordinal numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) because that is
typically how police precincts are referred to in New York City. There are many
other functions in the `scales` package that format numbers in different ways,
including `comma()` to add thousands separators to numbers and `dollar()` to
format numbers as values in dollars or other currencies. There is a [full list 
of `scales` functions on the package website](https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/).


<!--

You might have noticed on the map above that the density layer does not cover
the whole surface of the map. This is because there are some parts of the Bronx
that did not have any shootings in 2019. Some of these areas are under water,
for example. Since our map is about shootings, it would be better if we zoomed
in to just the places where shootings occurred. We can restrict the map to just
the area within the bounding box of the shootings data (i.e. the smallest
rectangle that contains all the shooting locations) by adding the `coord_sf()`
function to the stack of functions that we add to `ggplot()`. Since we have 
already saved the map as an object, we will do this by adding the new function 
to the existing object and then saving the result as a new object.

```{r title-exercise2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=17, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Find the bounding box of shootings -- we have to convert the shootings data to
# an SF object to do this
shootings_bbox <- shootings %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326) %>% 
  st_bbox()

# Use coord_sf() to crop our map to the bounding box of shootings
shootings_map <- first_shootings_map +
  coord_sf(
    xlim = shootings_bbox[c(1, 3)], 
    ylim = shootings_bbox[c(2, 4)], 
    expand = FALSE
  )

# Display the map
shootings_map
```

<div class="box extra-detail">

<h5 id="title-box1-title" class="box-title">What does the code 
`shootings_bbox[c(1, 3)]` do?</h5>

<div id="title-box1" class="box-content">

You might be wondering what the code `shootings_bbox[c(1, 3)]` does. When an R
object contains a sequence of values (`shootings_bbox` contains four values), we
can usually extract one value or more values by adding square brackets to the
end of the object name and then giving the index number of the value we want 
(the first value has the index 1, the second value has the index 2, etc.). This
is called *subsetting*. To subset a single value, just give the index inside
the square brackets, e.g. `shootings_bbox[1]`. To get subset multiple values,
give a vector (created with `c()`) of index numbers for the values you want.
R can subset values in lots of different ways for different types of values,
but we will discuss it in further detail if we need to later on.

</div>

<script>

</script>

-->


We now have a basic map of shootings in the Bronx. This map isn't good enough on
its own, but we can use it to learn how to add supporting elements to a map.



## Titles

A map title is one of the most important ways to add context to a map. Titles
should usually make it clear what the main message of the map is. When choosing
a title, ask yourself what one thing you would want someone to remember after
they had finished looking at the map. You may want to try several different
titles so that you can choose the one that communicates your message most
clearly.

We can add a title to our map using the `labs()` (short for 'labels') function 
from the `ggplot2` package. We can use `labs()` to add labels to various 
different parts of a map or plot, but for now we will just use the argument
`title = ` to set the title. 

```{r title-exercise3, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
shootings_map + 
  labs(title = "Shootings are focused in the South Bronx")
```

Sometimes our preferred title might be too long to fit on a map. In this case,
we can break the title across two or more lines. We can do this manually by
adding the characters `\n` (the character code for a new line) at the point
where we want the text to start a new line. Alternatively, we can use the
`str_wrap()` function from the `stringr` package to wrap the text automatically
into lines of a given maximum length (specified using the `wrap` argument).

Adding a subtitle is very easy using the `subtitle` argument to the `labs()`
function. Use the code above as a template to add a subtitle to your map
explaining that the map shows fatal and non-fatal shootings in 2019. 

```{r title-exercise4, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

```

```{r title-exercise4-hint-1}
# add a `subtitle` argument to the labs() function
shootings_map + 
  labs(title = "Shootings are focused in the South Bronx")
```

```{r title-exercise4-hint-2}
shootings_map + 
  labs(
    title = "Shootings are focused in the South Bronx",
    subtitle = "Fatal and non-fatal shootings recorded by NYC Police, 2019"
  )
```


### Using captions to add author and other information

The `labs()` function has one more argument that we can use to add text to our
map for context. The `caption` argument is used to add information such as
the author, date and source of the data to a map or chart. We can put any 
information we like into the caption, using `str_wrap()` or the new-line 
character `\n` if necessary to stop the text overflowing the map.

```{r title-exercise5, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
shootings_map + 
  labs(
    title = "Shootings are focused in the South Bronx",
    subtitle = "Fatal and non-fatal shootings recorded by NYC Police, 2019",
    caption = str_glue(
      "Author: Joe Bloggs, Date produced: {lubridate::today()},\n",
      "Data: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/833y-fsy8"
    )
  )
```

This code uses the `str_glue()` function from the `stringr` package to 
incorporate some automatically updated information (in this case, the current
date) into the caption. `str_glue()` glues together any number of character
strings separated by commas -- in this case, the code includes two strings so 
that the lines of code do not become too long to easily read.

`str_glue()` can also include the values of R objects and the results of R
functions that are placed inside braces `{}`. So the code `{lubridate::today()}`
runs the function `today()` from the `lubridate` package and glues the result
(the current date) into the text. If we had already loaded the `lubridate`
library we could have just used the code `{today()}`, but since we do not need
any other functions from `lubridate` for this analysis, we instead do not load
the package but call the function by specifying which package it comes from 
using the `::` operator as in the previous tutorial.


### Changing the appearance of titles and captions

We have added a title, subtitle and caption to our map, but you might not be
happy with their appearance. You might want, for example, to move the caption
down the visual hierarchy by making the text smaller and/or a lighter colour,
or add some space between the subtitle and the map itself.

We can exercise almost complete control over the supporting elements of maps or
charts made with `ggplot()` using the `theme()` function. One important thing to
remember about `theme()` is that it only controls the non-data elements of a
map -- nothing you do with the `theme()` function will have any effect on the 
data elements of a map (in this case, the layer showing the density of 
shootings). To change the appearance of data layers within `ggplot()` maps,
use the `geom_` and `scale_` families of functions as we have learned in 
previous tutorials.

The `theme()` function has a lot of potential arguments. If you need help using 
the `theme()` function (or any function in R) you can view a manual page 
(including a list of arguments) for the function by: 

  * typing a question mark followed by the function name without parentheses 
    (e.g. `?theme`) into the R console,
  * typing the function name without parentheses into the search box in the
    Help panel in RStudio, or
  * clicking on the function name anywhere in your R code to place the cursor
    on the function name, then pressing `F1` on your keyboard.

Try opening the manual page for `theme()` now to see the list of possible
arguments it can take. Fortunately, we will not need most of these arguments
most of the time -- `ggplot()` has default values built in for every value that
can be changed using `theme()`, and these defaults will be reasonable in almost
all cases.

To reduce the visual prominence of the map caption, we can change the value of
the `plot.caption` argument to `theme()`. Since the caption is a text 
element (rather than a polygon, line, etc.), we can use the helper function 
`element_text()` to do this. The following code changes the colour of 
the caption text to a lighter grey and makes the text smaller relative to the
default using the helper function `rel()` (for relative sizing) -- `0.7` means
the text will be 70% as big as it would have been by default.

```{r title-exercise6, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
shootings_map +
  labs(
    title = "Shootings are focused in the South Bronx",
    subtitle = "Fatal and non-fatal shootings recorded by NYC Police, 2019",
    caption = str_glue(
      "Author: Joe Bloggs, Date produced: {lubridate::today()},\n",
      "Data: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/833y-fsy8"
    )
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.caption = element_text(colour = "grey50", size = rel(0.7))
  )
```

The helper function `element_text()` has arguments to control the appearance of
text in different ways. As well as `colour` (or `color`, either is fine) and
`size`, there are:

  * `family` controls the font used, e.g. Times New Roman or Helvetica,
  * `face` controls the style of the font, i.e. 'plain', 'italic', 'bold' or
    'bold.italic',
  * `hjust` controls the horizontal justification of the text, where 0 means
    left aligned, 0.5 means centred and 1 means right aligned,
  * `vjust` controls the vertical justification, and
  * `angle` controls the angle (in degrees) of the text (0 means horizontal),
  * `lineheight` controls the space between lines if you have created a value
    that has more than one line (e.g. using `\n` or `str_wrap()`).

The `margin` argument controls the space around the text. It is easiest to
specify the value of `margin` using the helper function `margin()` designed for
that purpose. You specify the top, right, bottom and left margin separately in
that order -- to remember the order, think '**tr**ou**bl**e'.

The following code changes the margin around the map subtitle. Change this code
so that it *also* makes the subtitle 80% of the default size *and* changes the
caption so that it is left aligned.

```{r title-exercise7, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
shootings_map +
  labs(
    title = "Shootings are focused in the South Bronx",
    subtitle = "Fatal and non-fatal shootings recorded by NYC Police, 2019",
    caption = str_glue(
      "Author: Joe Bloggs, Date produced: {lubridate::today()},\n",
      "Data: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/833y-fsy8"
    )
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.subtitle = element_text(margin = margin(3, 0, 6, 0, unit = "pt")),
    plot.caption = element_text(colour = "grey50", size = rel(0.7))
  )
```

```{r title-exercise7-hint-1}
# Change the line `plot.subtitle = element_text(margin = margin(3, 0, 6, 0)),`
# so that it also specifies the text size
```

```{r title-exercise7-hint-2}
# You can change the size relative to the default using the `rel()` function
```

```{r title-exercise7-hint-3}
# Change the line `plot.caption = element_text(colour = "grey50", size = rel(0.7))`
# so that it also specifies the horizontal alignment of the text
```

```{r title-exercise7-hint-4}
# You can change the horizontal justification of the caption using the `hjust`
# argument to the `element_text()` function
```

```{r title-exercise7-hint-5}
shootings_map +
  labs(
    title = "Shootings are focused in the South Bronx",
    subtitle = "Fatal and non-fatal shootings recorded by NYC Police, 2019",
    caption = str_glue(
      "Author: Joe Bloggs, Date produced: {lubridate::today()},\n",
      "Data: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/833y-fsy8"
    )
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = rel(0.8), margin = margin(3, 0, 6, 0)),
    plot.caption = element_text(colour = "grey50", size = rel(0.7), hjust = 0)
  )
```

Now that we have finished setting the text elements for our map, we can save it
as a new object that we can use as the basis for the other objects we want to
add.

```{r title-exercise8, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
shootings_map_titled <- shootings_map +
  labs(
    title = "Shootings are focused in the South Bronx",
    subtitle = "Fatal and non-fatal shootings recorded by NYC Police, 2019",
    caption = str_glue(
      "Author: Joe Bloggs, Date produced: {lubridate::today()},\n",
      "Data: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/833y-fsy8"
    )
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = rel(0.8), margin = margin(3, 0, 6, 0)),
    plot.caption = element_text(colour = "grey50", size = rel(0.7), hjust = 0)
  )
```



## Legends

Legends are important for all but the simplest crime maps because they help
readers to interpret the points, lines and polygons used to represent data on a
particular map. Except for point maps containing only a small number of crimes
(such as the map of homicide in downtown Atlanta that we produced in the first
tutorial), crime maps will almost always need a legend to help users interpret
them.

Producing a legend manually could be quite complicated, but fortunately 
`ggplot()` produces legends automatically. The reason the maps we have produced
up to now haven't included legends is that we have been suppressing the legends
using the argument `legend.position = "none"` to the `theme()` function -- look
back at the code on the page 'Creating and storing a map' in this tutorial to
see this code on the final line of the stack of functions added to `ggplot()`.

`ggplot()` will add a legend to a map or chart whenever one or more layers of
data are represented using an aesthetic property such as size, shape, colour or 
fill. In our current map, the density of shootings is represented using the fill
colour of the polygons produced by the `geom_density_2d_filled()` function,
with darker colours representing more shootings.

To reveal the legend automatically generated, we can add another call to the
`theme()` function to our existing `ggplot()` object. This overrides the previous
code that set the legend position to `none`, instead placing the legend on the
right-hand side of the plot. We only need to do this because we previously
suppressed the legend -- if we had not suppressed it, the legend would have
appeared automatically.

```{r legend-exercise1, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
shootings_map_titled +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

Our map now has a legend, but we may want to adjust its appearance by:

  * changing the default legend title generated by `geom_density_2d_filled()`
    from 'level' to something more meaningful,
  * reversing the order of the legend so that *higher* density values appear 
    *higher* up the screen or page,
  * moving the legend down the visual hierarchy by making it smaller (at the 
    moment it takes up almost half as much space as the data),
  * removing the potentially confusing raw density values.

We can change the default legend title by once again using the `labs()` 
function. Since we want to change the title of the legend, you might reasonably
think that we would do this using something like `labs(legend = "density")` but
unfortunately that code would do nothing at all. Instead, we have to set the
legend title using the aesthetic (colour, size, shape, etc.) that the legend 
represents. This makes it possible to specify multiple titles if there are
separate legends for different layers that use different aesthetics, for example
if a map used lines of different colours to show streets of different types and 
filled polygons to show the density of crime.

```{r legend-exercise2, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
shootings_map_titled +
  labs(fill = "kernel density\nof shootings") +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

To reverse the order of the legend, we can add a call to the `guides()` function
to our existing `ggplot()` stack. `guides()` can be used to control the 
appearance of multiple legends for different layers, each one specified using
the aesthetic used to represent the data. For each guide, we can use the helper
function `guide_legend()` to specify the correct settings (there are other 
helper functions for different types of legend, but we don't need to know about
these now).

```{r legend-exercise3, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
shootings_map_titled +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +
  labs(fill = "kernel density\nof shootings") +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

To make the legend smaller, we can use `theme()` in the same way as we did to
change the appearance of the caption. We use the `legend.title` argument to
format the legend title and the `legend.text` argument to format the labels for
each value in the legend. 

We will also make the squares in the legend (called *keys* by `ggplot()`) 
slightly smaller using the `legend.key.size` argument. To do this we will use
the helper function `unit()`, which allows us to specify the size using any of
several common units. In this case, we will specify the key size in lines so 
that it is relative to the text size we have chosen.

```{r legend-exercise4, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
shootings_map_titled +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +
  labs(fill = "kernel density\nof shootings") +
  theme(
    legend.key.size = unit(0.8, "lines"),
    legend.position = "right",
    legend.text = element_text(size = rel(0.7)),
    legend.title = element_text(size = rel(0.8))
  )
```

Finally, we want to remove the raw density values, since these are difficult to
interpret and might distract readers from the key message that darker colours on
the map represent higher densities of shootings.

By default, `ggplot()` sets the label for each legend key based on the data. To
specify our own labels, we can use the `labels` argument to the 
`scale_fill_brewer()` function that we previously used to set the colour scheme 
of the density layer on the map. We must make sure we provide as many labels as
there are keys in the legend (in this case, nine). Since we want all the labels
to be blank except the first and last, we can either set the labels to be
`c("lower", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "higher")` or (if we don't want to type
seven pairs of empty quotes) we can use the `rep()` function to *repeat* the 
same value a given number of times.

```{r legend-exercise5, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
shootings_map_titled +
  scale_fill_brewer(labels = c("lower", rep("", 7), "higher")) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +
  labs(fill = "kernel density\nof shootings") +
  theme(
    legend.key.size = unit(0.8, "lines"),
    legend.position = "right",
    legend.text = element_text(size = rel(0.7)),
    legend.title = element_text(size = rel(0.8))
  )
```

Now that we have finished formatting the legend, we can again store the
map as an object that we can build on further.

```{r legend-exercise6, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
shootings_map_legend <- shootings_map_titled +
  scale_fill_brewer(labels = c("lower", rep("", 7), "higher")) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +
  labs(fill = "kernel density\nof shootings") +
  theme(
    legend.key.size = unit(0.8, "lines"),
    legend.position = "right",
    legend.text = element_text(size = rel(0.7)),
    legend.title = element_text(size = rel(0.8))
  )
```



## Scales and north arrows

The final elements we can add to our map are a scale bar and a north arrow, 
which can both be added using functions from the 
[`ggspatial` package](https://paleolimbot.github.io/ggspatial/) that provides
various functions to help display maps created using the `ggplot2` package.


### Scale bars

To add a scale bar, we can add a call to the `annotation_scale()` function to 
our existing `ggplot()` object.

```{r scales-exercise1, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
library(ggspatial)

shootings_map_legend +
  annotation_scale()
```

The default scale bar is a little too visually dominant for its low place in the
visual hierarchy of our map, and the default placement in the bottom-left corner
happens to overlap with the highest density of shootings. We can change the 
scale bar using arguments to the `annotation_scale()` function:

  * `width_hint = 1/5` changes the (approximate) proportion of the map width
    across which the scale bar stretches, 
  * `style = "ticks"` changes the style of the scale bar to the less visually
    prominent line-and-tick-marks style, and
  * `location = "br"` moves the scale bar to the bottom-right corner of the map.

```{r scales-exercise2, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
shootings_map_legend +
  annotation_scale(width_hint = 1/5, style = "ticks", location = "br")
```


### North arrows

We can add a north arrow using the `annotation_north_arrow()` function. The
default arrow is too obtrusive to fit its position in the visual hierarchy, so 
we will change its appearance using the arguments:

  * `location = "tr"` to move the north arrow to the top-right corner, since we
    have put the scale bar in the bottom-right where the north arrow would be 
    placed by default,
  * `height = unit(1.5, "lines")` to make the arrow smaller, and
  * `style = north_arrow_minimal(text_size = 8)` to use a smaller style of 
    arrow, at the same time reducing the font size of the N symbol.

```{r scales-exercise3, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
shootings_map_legend +
  annotation_scale(width_hint = 1/5, style = "ticks", location = "br") +
  annotation_north_arrow(
    location = "tr", 
    height = unit(1.5, "lines"), 
    style = north_arrow_minimal(text_size = 8)
  )
```



## Saving maps

Once you have a complete map, it is often useful to save it as an image file so
that you can share it with others or embed it into a report or presentation. You
can save plots created with `ggplot()` using the `ggsave()` function.

Before we do that, lets create a final map that includes a base map as well as
some supporting elements. We won't include a north arrow because north is at the
top of the map and it's unlikely anyone will be using this map for navigation.
We will include a scale bar so that people looking at the map can see the 
approximate size of shooting hotspots. Remember we have already loaded the
necessary packages, as well as data stored in the `shootings`, `precincts` and
`base_map` objects.

```{r save-exercise1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=49, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# Create map object
shootings_map_final <- ggmap(base_map) +
  geom_density_2d_filled(
    aes(x = longitude, y = latitude),
    data = shootings,
    inherit.aes = FALSE,
    bins = 9,
    adjust = 0.5,
    alpha = 0.7,
    na.rm = TRUE
  ) +
  geom_sf(data = precincts, colour = "grey33", fill = NA, inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_sf_label(
    aes(label = scales::ordinal(precinct)), 
    data = precincts,
    alpha = 0.5, 
    colour = "grey33", 
    lineheight = 0.9, 
    size = 2.5, 
    label.size = NA, 
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer(
    palette = "PuBu", 
    labels = c("lower", rep("", 7), "higher")
  ) +
  annotation_scale(width_hint = 1/5, style = "ticks", location = "br") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +
  labs(
    title = "Shootings are focused in the South Bronx",
    subtitle = "Fatal and non-fatal shootings recorded by NYC Police, 2019",
    caption = str_glue(
      "Author: Joe Bloggs, Date produced: {lubridate::today()},\n",
      "Data: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/833y-fsy8"
    ),
    fill = "kernel density\nof shootings"
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    legend.key.size = unit(0.8, "lines"),
    legend.position = "right",
    legend.text = element_text(size = rel(0.7)),
    legend.title = element_text(size = rel(0.8)),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = rel(0.8), margin = margin(3, 0, 6, 0)),
    plot.caption = element_text(colour = "grey50", size = rel(0.7), hjust = 0)
  )

# Display map
shootings_map_final
```

`ggsave()` can create image files in many different formats, including PNG, 
JPEG and PDF. `ggsave()` will determine which type of file to create according
to the file extension of the file name that you specify. So 
`ggsave("bronx_shootings_2019.pdf", plot = shootings_map_legend)` produces a PDF 
file, while `ggsave("bronx_shootings_2019.jpg", plot = shootings_map_legend)` 
produces a JPEG image file.

You can specify the size of the image that will be saved using the `height` and
`width` arguments. Note that for historical reasons these values are in *inches*
by default, but you can change this to either centimetres (using `units = "cm"`)
or millimetres (using `units = "mm"`). If you want to specify the image size in
pixels, you can take advantage of the default setting that there are 300 pixels 
per inch and specify (for example) `width = 800 / 300` to produce an image 800 
pixels wide.

To share our map with others, lets save it as an A4-size PDF.

```{r save-exercise2, exercise=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggsave(
  "bronx_shootings_2019.pdf", 
  plot = shootings_map_final, 
  width = 210,
  height = 297,
  units = "mm"
)
```

We can now use share this file by email, upload it to a website or embed it in
another document.



## In summary

<div class="box welldone">

In this tutorial we have learned about the importance of understanding the 
purpose for which people will use a map when making decisions about map design.
We have also learned about how establishing a visual hierarchy on our map can
help steer readers towards the most-important elements and how to add titles,
legends and scale bars to maps in R.
