<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Imagine you’ve been working on some analysis intermittently for a few
weeks. Unless you’re very lucky, you’re likely to experience one or more
of these common problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>As you work, you create various different files (for example
containing the data you are using, code you have written and charts you
have made) until it becomes difficult to keep track of what is in each
file and how different files relate to each other.</li>
<li>It becomes difficult to remember exactly what data and which code
produced which chart, so that if someone has a question about how you
came to a particular conclusion it is difficult to be sure. Likewise, if
you discover a mistake in your code then it is hard to know what outputs
it affected.</li>
<li>If you need to take a break from your work (perhaps to work on
something else) and come back to it later, it becomes irritating to have
to close all the code and other files you are working on and then open
them again later.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this can make data analysis much harder, especially if you’re
trying to find a particular file or check if a result is correct just
before a deadline.</p>
<p class="full-width-image">
<img src="images/data_cowboy.jpg" alt="Cartoon of a furry monster lassoing several sheets of data">
</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can solve these problems using a combination of the
RStudio Projects feature and a plan for organising our files. Once
you’ve formed the habit of working in this way, it becomes second nature
and you’ll find your work is both easier and produces more-reliable
results.</p>

<div id="section-rstudio-projects" class="section level2">
<h2>RStudio Projects</h2>
<p>Projects in RStudio are a way of keeping your analysis organised.
When you work inside an project, RStudio will do various things in the
background that make it easier to stay organised. For example, RStudio
will save the project’s <em>state</em>: if you have to close the project
and re-open it later, all the files that you had open before will
re-open, too.</p>
<div class="box notewell">
<p><strong>I strongly recommend that you use projects for everything you
do in RStudio.</strong> There are no real costs to using projects and
the benefits can be substantial, so try to get used to using them for
all your analysis. Have one RStudio project for each project that you
work on, for example you might have one project for each research report
that you write or piece of analysis you do on a particular topic.</p>
</div>
<p>To create a new project from within RStudio, click <code>File</code>
then <code>New Project …</code> and choose to create the project in a
new directory on your computer:</p>
<p class="full-width-image">
<img src="images/new_project_1.png" alt="Screenshot of an RStudio window for choosing between opening a new project in a new directory, in an existing directory or based on a project from a version-control system">
</p>
<p>Choose to create a new (empty) project, rather than use any of the
templates for specific types of projects:</p>
<p class="full-width-image">
<img src="/images/new_project_2.png" alt="Screenshot of an RStudio window for choosing from different types of RStudio project">
</p>
<p>Choose what the new project
<abbr title="directories on your computer are also sometimes called folders">
directory</abbr> should be called, and where on your computer it should
be created (you might want to create a ‘Crime Mapping’ directory to hold
all the projects you will create during this course), then click
<code>Create Project</code>:</p>
<p class="full-width-image">
<img src="images/new_project_3.png" alt="Screenshot of an RStudio window for choosing the directory that should be used for a new project">
</p>
<p>That’s it – you have created an RStudio project that you can organise
your work in.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-organising-a-project" class="section level2">
<h2>Organising a project</h2>
<p>Now you’ve created an empty project, you can create some directories
within it to organise your files. There are lots of suggestions online
for how to organise your files within a project – see this <a
href="https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/resources-on-project-directory-organization/340/1">summary
of project-organisation methods if you would like to understand the
different options available</a> – but the most important thing is that
you have separate places to store:</p>
<ul>
<li>the original/raw data that you have obtained (e.g. by downloading it
from a website or extracting it from a police database),</li>
<li>the results of any data wrangling that you do,</li>
<li>files containing the code that you use to wrangle the data and
conduct your analysis, and finally,</li>
<li>the outputs from your analysis, including tables, charts and
reports.</li>
</ul>
<p>Putting each of these four types of files in a separate directory
within the project directory makes it much easier to keep track of them.
We can create the necessary directories directly in R using the
<code>dir.create()</code> function.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="project-exercise1"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code># `dir.create()` does not produce any output unless there is a problem
dir.create(&quot;source_data&quot;)
dir.create(&quot;analysis_data&quot;)
dir.create(&quot;code&quot;)
dir.create(&quot;outputs&quot;)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<div class="box notewell">
<p>Because we are running these commands from inside an RStudio project,
these directories will automatically be created as subdirectories of the
project directory we have already created – this saves a lot of moving
between directories, and is another reason to use RStudio projects.</p>
<p>Once you are working within an RStudio project, RStudio knows to
treat any reference to a file or folder as being relative to the folder
that contains the RStudio project. So, for example, if your project for
analysis of thefts in Vancouver is stored in a folder called
<code>/Documents/crime_mapping/vancouver_thefts/</code> and you run the
R code <code>read_csv("source_data/vancouver_thefts.csv")</code>,
RStudio knows that you mean to open the file stored at
<code>/Documents/crime_mapping/vancouver_thefts/source_data/vancouver_thefts.csv</code>.
This can save you lots of time working out how to reference a particular
file location in R.</p>
</div>
<div class="box extra-detail">
<h5 id="project-box1-title" class="box-title">
What about setting a working directory?
</h5>
<div id="section-project-box1" class="box-content">
<p>If you have learned some R before this course – especially if it was
some time ago or taught by someone who themselves learned R a long time
ago – you might have learned to start each analysis by setting a
<em>working directory</em> using the <code>setwd()</code> function or
the <code>Session &gt; Set Working Directory</code> menu option in
RStudio. Not only do you not need to do this when you keep your analysis
in an RStudio project, <strong>you should not set a working directory in
R</strong> because it can have several unpleasant side effects.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with manually setting a working directory in your
R code is that if you share your code with someone else then it is
likely the <code>setwd()</code> function will produce an error because
that person’s computer will have a different directory structure to your
computer. So if the first line of your R script is
<code>setwd("/Users/uctzaaa/Documents/crime_mapping_vancouver_thefts/")</code>
because that is the location of the working directory on your computer,
this will produce an error on another computer that does not have a
<code>/Users/uctzaaa</code> directory (i.e. it will cause an error on
almost every computer in the world). This makes it much harder to get
help on your code, for example if you are using a reproducible example
(reprex) to show someone else a problem with your code.</p>
<p>Setting a working directory using the
<code>Session &gt; Set Working Directory</code> menu buttons in RStudio
has the additional problem that it’s not possible to work out from
reading your R code that you have set the working directory that way. So
if someone else (or you, in a few weeks when you’ve forgotten) tried to
run your code and it produced an error, there would be nothing in the
code to tell them that they needed to change the working directory.</p>
<p>For more detail on why you should not set a working directory
manually, read this <a
href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/">blog
post on project-oriented workflow</a>.</p>

<p>Typing out the <code>dir.create()</code> function four times is
somewhat tedious, and certainly would be if we needed to create (say) 10
directories rather than four. One way to make this code shorter is to
use the <code>walk()</code> function from the <a
href="https://purrr.tidyverse.org/"><code>purrr</code> package</a>,
which is part of the tidyverse suite of packages. <code>walk()</code>
allows us to run any function several times, each time using a different
input, one at a time. The function is called <code>walk()</code> because
it ‘walks’ through all the items in a vector of inputs, applying the
same function to each of them in turn.</p>
<p>The general format of calls to the <code>walk()</code> function
is:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>walk(vector_of_inputs, function_name_to_apply_to_those_inputs)</code></pre>
<p>So if we wanted to create the same four directories using
<code>walk()</code>, we could:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="project-exercise2"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>purrr::walk(c(&quot;source_data&quot;, &quot;analysis_data&quot;, &quot;code&quot;, &quot;outputs&quot;), dir.create)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Note that the function name <code>dir.create</code> is not followed
by a pair of parentheses when it is used inside <code>walk()</code>.</p>
<p><code>walk()</code> is a very powerful function and this is only a
very simple example of what it can do, but we will return to it when we
need it again.</p>
<div class="box extra-detail">
<h5 id="project-box2-title" class="box-title">
Why didn’t we use a loop instead of <code>walk()</code>?
</h5>
<div id="section-project-box2" class="box-content">
<p>If you have learned any other programming languages, you might
remember that the usual way to apply the same function to a series of
values is to use a ‘loop’, which (depending on the language) might be
called a ‘for loop’ or a ‘foreach loop’. While you can create ‘for’
loops in R that would do the same thing as the <code>walk()</code>
function, it is generally better not to use ‘for’ loops in R. This is
both because <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/30241011/8222654">loops are often
slower</a> – which can be particularly important when analysing large
spatial datasets – and because functions like <code>walk()</code> can
easily be used inside pipelines constructed with the <code>|&gt;</code>
operator.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re ever tempted to use a ‘for’ loop in R, stop and
think about how to achieve the same result using a function like
<code>walk()</code>.</strong></p>

</div>
<div id="section-naming-files" class="section level2">
<h2>Naming files</h2>
<p>The final step in organising your work so that you can analyse data
and stay sane is to give every file you create a name that will help you
find it later on. To do this, stick to three principles:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>make your file names easily readable by <em>computers</em>,</li>
<li>make your file names easily readable by <em>humans</em>, and</li>
<li>use file names that will by-default by <em>sorted</em> in a
meaningful way.</li>
</ol>
<p>Computers can increasingly read file names that contain any
characters you can think of, but many different characters make
referencing your file names in your code more difficult than need be. To
keep your code simple, stick to files names that contain only
<em>lower-case</em> letters (so you don’t have to remember if each
letter is upper-case or lower-case), numbers, hyphens (<code>-</code>)
and underscores (<code>_</code>) – that’s it. If your language uses
letters with accents, its best to not use those accents in file names.
So, instead of having files with names like this:</p>
<pre><code>John&#39;s raw data.csv
figure 4.jpg
DüsseldorfCrimeData.xlsx</code></pre>
<p>use the names:</p>
<pre><code>john_raw_data.csv
figure_4.jpg
dusseldorf_crime_data.xlsx</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/1459/"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/documents.png" alt="Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Untitled.doc" style="width: 33%; max-width: 300px; float: right; margin: 0 0 2em 2em;"></a></p>
<p>To make your files easily readable by humans, make sure the file name
describes what the file contains or does. So giving a file the name
<code>crime_data_atlanta_2020.csv</code> is much more useful than
calling the same file <code>data_file_23.csv</code>. If you’ve been
using computers for a while (or you’ve been taught by someone who has),
you may have been trained to use very short file names because old
computers could only handle very short names. Fortunately, modern
computers can handle much longer file names, so it’s generally safe to
use a few extra characters to describe what your file is or does. File
names are also easier to read if words are separated by a hyphen or
underscore: <code>police_recorded_robbery_data_2020</code> is much
easier to read than <code>policerecordedrobberydata2020</code>.</p>
<p>If your files have a meaningful order, it’s useful to reflect this in
the file name. Imagine you have three code files: one for data
wrangling, one for carrying out spatial analysis tasks on that wrangled
data and a third one for creating charts to show the results of the
analysis. You cannot run the analysis code until the data wrangling is
complete, so the files have a meaningful order.</p>
<p>When you look at these files in the Windows File Explorer, Mac Finder
or RStudio Files tab, they are likely to appear out of order. For
example, they might be:</p>
<pre><code>analyse_data.R
create_charts.R
wrangle_data.R</code></pre>
<p>If you add a number to the start of the file name to show which order
to use the files in, things become clearer:</p>
<pre><code>01_wrangle_data.R
02_analyse_data.R
03_create_charts.R</code></pre>
<p>Note that the numbers are padded with a zero so that they will still
be sorted in the correct order if you end up with more than 10 files in
my workflow (I’ve only used one zero for padding because I don’t expect
to have more than 100 files).</p>
