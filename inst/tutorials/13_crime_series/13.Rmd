<!-- Case linkage: http://eknygos.lsmuni.lt/springer/605/117-133.pdf -->


## Introduction

It's common in crime mapping to treat each crime as a separate event. But a 
large proportion of crimes are committed by a relatively small proportion of all
the people who commit crime. These persistent or repeat offenders commit crimes
frequently, maybe several times a day in the case of some people. One type of
repeat offending is the *crime series*, in which an offender or group of 
offenders commits the same or related crimes in different places over time. 

When you read about serial offenders you might think about serial killers, but
many types of crime can occur in series. One of the most common is burglary, in
which a serial burglar breaks into many properties in an area over a period of
days, weeks or months. Watch this short video to find out how police used crime
mapping to help catch a serial burglar.

![](https://youtu.be/fbrJNa9mBG8)

In this video you can hear the police officers explaining that they had linked
the offences they believed were committed by this serial offender because of 
similarities in the items stolen and the method used to gain entry to the 
houses. *Case linkage* is the process of identifying crime series by looking for
similarities in the method used by an offender (e.g. entering a house by 
breaking a lock on a side door out of sight from the street) or by evidence left
at the scene (such as fingerprints or DNA). Case linkage is typically an 
imperfect process -- investigators might believe that two offences were 
committed by the same person, but in most cases they are unlikely to know for 
sure.

Crime mapping can help police and other agencies to understand crime series. In
this tutorial we will learn how to map linked cases and how to estimate where 
offenders are most likely to be based using geographic profiling.


### The cases used in this tutorial

Due to the uncertainty of case linkage, there is little publicly available data
on the locations of serial crimes. The available data tends to focus on serial
murders. To minimise the likelihood of anyone taking this course having been
directly affected by -- or know anyone affected by -- the cases we use in the
examples, this tutorial will use two historical examples.

```{r include=FALSE}
hungerford_murder_count <- hungerford_shootings %>% 
  mutate(murder_count = str_count(victims, "†")) %>% 
  summarise(murder_count = sum(murder_count)) %>% 
  pull(murder_count)
```

<p class="full-width-image image-border"><img src="images/roger_brereton.jpg" alt="Photograph from the funeral of police constable Roger Brereton, one of the people killed in the Hungerford Massacre"></p>

The [Hungerford massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungerford_massacre) 
occurred in southern England in August 1987, when a marauding attacker killed 
`r hungerford_murder_count` people and shot many others in the space of about 90 
minutes. We will use a dataset called `hungerford_shootings` that contains the
names of each victim and the approximate location at which they were shot 
(recorded as eastings and northings in the British National Grid). This data is 
taken from the 
[official report into the massacre](https://www.jesip.org.uk/uploads/media/incident_reports_and_inquiries/Hungerford%20Shootings.pdf). The `order` column shows the order in which the victims were
shot. These are the first few rows of the dataset (the dagger symbol † shows 
that the victim was killed):

```{r}
hungerford_shootings %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  knitr::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

The [canal murders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewer_Murders) were a series
of murders of teenage boys near Frankfurt between 1982 and 1983. In each case
the victims' bodies were placed into drainage channels near to sewage treatment
plants. Two of the bodies were found at the locations of previous bodies, 
several months after the first body at each place had been found. 

Not all the victims could be identified due to the time that had elapsed
before their bodies were discovered. The cases were linked not only by the 
similarity in the locations where the bodies were found, but also the age and 
sex of the victims and the cause of death. Nevertheless it is possible that not
all of the offences were committed by the same offender. The data are stored in
the `canal_murders` SF object, of which these are the first five rows:

```{r}
canal_murders %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  knitr::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

## Mapping linked cases

Mapping crime series can be useful for several reasons. For example, a map of a
crime series might help the jurors in a criminal trial to better understand the
sequence of events that the suspect is accused of. This can be especially 
helpful if the sequence is complicated or especially long.

At the moment, the `hungerford_shootings` dataset contains the *point* location 
of each event and the order in which they occurred. To show a sequence of events 
on a map, we need to link each event with those that happened immediately before 
and after it. 

```{r}
hungerford_shootings %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  knitr::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

One way to do this is to draw lines on the map connecting each incident in turn. 
To generate lines between the points, we:

  1. `arrange()` the data using so that the rows are sorted from the first 
     shooting to the last (this will be important at step 6).
  2. Since the co-ordinates are represented using the British National Grid but
     we will need to plot them on a map that uses the WGS84 co-ordinate system,
     convert the data to an SF object using `st_as_sf()` and then transform it
     to WGS84 using `st_transform()`.
  3. Extract the co-ordinates from this transformed SF object using 
     `st_coordinates()` since we want to manipulate the co-ordinates directly
     (at step 6) and because the `geom_segment()` function we will use to plot 
     the lines needs the co-ordinates stored in separate columns because it does 
     not understand SF objects. Convert the result produced by 
     `st_coordinates()` to a tibble with `as_tibble()` and add a column 
     representing the order in which the shootings took place using `mutate()`.
  4. `rename()` the columns containing the co-ordinates to make it clear these 
      co-ordinates will represent the *end* of each line.
  5. Use `mutate()` and `lag()` to create two new columns containing the `x` 
     and `y` co-ordinates from the line *above* each line in the data. These 
     co-ordinates will represent the start of each line.
  6. `slice()` the data to remove the first line, since the number of lines 
     connecting the points is one fewer than the number of points. `n()` in the
     code below is a helper function representing the number of rows in the
     dataset.

We will store the result of step 2 in an object called `hungerford_sf` since
we can also use this to generate a bounding box later, and the result of step 3
in an object called `hungerford_wgs84` because we can use it to plot the points
themselves on the map.

```{r linked-exercise1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=21, out.width="100%"}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)

hungerford_sf <- hungerford_shootings %>%
  arrange(order) %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("easting", "northing"), crs = 27700) %>% 
  st_transform(4326)

hungerford_wgs84 <- hungerford_sf %>% 
  st_coordinates() %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(order = row_number())

hungerford_lines <- hungerford_wgs84 %>% 
  rename(x_end = x, y_end = y) %>% 
  mutate(x_start = lag(x_end), y_start = lag(y_end)) %>% 
  slice(2:n())

head(hungerford_lines)
```

Now we have an object containing the start and end points of lines linking each 
point in the sequence of shootings at Hungerford, we can plot these on a map 
with a base map.

```{r linked-exercise2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=27, out.width="100%"}
library(ggmap)

# Transform the points to use the British National Grid, so we can generate a
# 1km buffer around it to make it easier to see the data points. Then transform 
# the points back to the WGS84 co-ordinate system used by functions from the 
# ggmap() package and download the base map tiles.
hungerford_basemap <- hungerford_sf %>% 
  st_transform(27700) %>% 
  st_buffer(1000) %>% 
  st_transform(4326) %>% 
  st_bbox() %>% 
  set_names(c("left", "bottom", "right", "top")) %>%
  get_stamenmap(zoom = 13, maptype = "toner-lite")

# Plot the map
ggmap(hungerford_basemap) +
  # Plot sequence of events as lines
  geom_segment(
    aes(x = x_start, y = y_start, xend = x_end, yend = y_end),
    data = hungerford_lines, 
    inherit.aes = FALSE,
    colour = "grey40"
  ) +
  # Plot shooting locations as points
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y), data = hungerford_wgs84, inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  theme_void()
```

This map shows the sequence of events, but there are at least three ways that we
can make it better.

  1. We don't know which order to move through the sequence of lines. We can 
     deal with this by adding arrows to show the direction of travel.
  2. The straight lines make it look like the offender travelled across fields
     between locations, which is probably not true. Since we do not have data on
     what routes the offender took, we can replace the straight lines with 
     curves to indicate that the exact route is unknown.
  3. Because the first two shootings occurred outside the town, the map has to
     cover a large area and this makes it harder to see the sequence of events 
     in the town itself.

### Adding arrows and curves

To add an arrow to the end of each line segment we can use the `arrow()`
helper function from the `ggplot2` package to specify the `arrow` argument of
the `geom_segment()` function in our `ggmap()` stack. Here, we make the arrow
head smaller than the default by setting `length = unit(3, "mm")` and choose the
style of the arrow head with `type = "closed"`.

To prevent the arrow heads from obscuring the points, we will give the points a
thin white border by specifying `shape = 21` (a circle with a separate border)
and `colour = "white"`, as well as making the points slightly bigger with 
`size = 3`.

```{r linked-exercise3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=19, out.width="100%"}
ggmap(hungerford_basemap) +
  geom_segment(
    aes(x = x_start, y = y_start, xend = x_end, yend = y_end),
    data = hungerford_lines, 
    inherit.aes = FALSE,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(3, "mm"), type = "closed"),
    colour = "orange3"
  ) +
  geom_point(
    aes(x = x, y = y), 
    data = hungerford_wgs84, 
    inherit.aes = FALSE,
    shape = 21,
    colour = "white",
    fill = "orange3",
    size = 3
  ) +
  theme_void()
```

This makes it easier to see that the shootings started at the point on the left
of the map, but makes the problem of understanding the sequence of events in the
town itself even worse. We will deal with this in the next section.

In the map above, we used the `geom_segment()` function to add the lines to our
map. If we change this to `geom_curve()` the lines will become curved rather
than straight. By specifying `curvature = -0.2` we get a slightly straighter
line than the default, and a left-hand curve because the value of `curvature` is
negative (play around with this in the code box below to see how this argument
works).

Behind the scenes, R has to make various calculations to create the curved line
between each shooting. These calculations are made more complicated by the base
map layer on the map being an SF object and the point and line layers being
data frames. To make these calculations possible, we have to specify 
`coord_sf(crs = 4326)` -- if you forget to do this you will see a warning 
`geom_curve is not implemented for non-linear coordinates` and the curves on the
map will be obviously incorrect. We will save this map as an object because we
will need it later on.

The other layer we can add to our map is a layer of labels showing the order in
which the shootings occurred. We don't want the labels to overlap the points, so
we will use `geom_label_repel()` from the `ggrepel` package to create labels 
that are automatically offset from the points they relate to. For now, we will
just label the first two locations. 

At this point we can also make some minor changes to the map -- adding a title
and scale bar, putting a neat line around the map -- the purpose of which will
become clear in the next section.

```{r linked-exercise4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=42, out.width="100%"}
library(ggrepel)

hungerford_map_overall <- ggmap(hungerford_basemap) +
  geom_curve(
    aes(x = x_start, y = y_start, xend = x_end, yend = y_end),
    data = hungerford_lines, 
    inherit.aes = FALSE,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(3, "mm"), type = "closed"),
    curvature = -0.2,
    colour = "orange3"
  ) +
  geom_point(
    aes(x = x, y = y), 
    data = hungerford_wgs84, 
    inherit.aes = FALSE,
    shape = 21,
    colour = "white",
    fill = "orange3",
    size = 3
  ) +
  geom_label_repel(
    aes(x = x, y = y, label = order),
    data = filter(hungerford_wgs84, order %in% 1:2), 
    inherit.aes = FALSE,
    colour = "white",
    fill = "orange3",
    fontface = "bold",
    label.size = NA,
  ) +
  annotation_scale(style = "ticks", line_col = "grey40", text_col = "grey40") +
  labs(
    title = " Shootings in Wiltshire"
  ) +
  coord_sf(crs = 4326) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    panel.border = element_rect(colour = "grey20", fill = NA),
    plot.title = element_text(margin = margin(b = -18))
  )

hungerford_map_overall
```

Now we have added arrow heads and curved lines, in the next section we will
learn how to solve the problem of the events in the town itself being unclear on
the map.



## Multiple maps

Our existing map is difficult to understand because we have a mix of some events
very close together (including several on the same street) and some that 
occurred further away. This means the closer events overlap on the map, 
especially now that we have made the points larger to distinguish them from the
lines linking each event.

To deal with this problem we can display two maps: one showing the whole area 
covered by the points and a second (sometimes called an *inset map*) showing 
only the events in the town of Hungerford itself. We will do this using the 
[`patchwork` package](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) to combine multiple
maps made using `ggmap()`.

We have already saved the first map as `hungerford_map_overall`. We can create a
map showing only the shootings in Hungerford itself by removing the first two
points from `hungerford_sf` then downloading a new base map based on that layer 
and plotting the result. Because some rows in the data will be outside the map
area, we will add `na.rm = TRUE` to each layer to specify that off-map rows 
should be removed from the data without generating a warning.

We will use the `plot.margin` argument to the `theme()` function to add a small 
amount of space at the top of this map, which will help separate it from the 
first map when we put them together.

```

We can now combine the two maps using the `patchwork` package. To place two 
plots next to each other using `patchwork` you just add one map object to the
other using the `|` operator. To place one plot on top of the other, you use the
`/` operator (you can combine plots in more-complicated ways by combining these
operators, together with parentheses).

```{r multiple-exercise2, exercise=TRUE, fig.asp=1}
library(patchwork)

(hungerford_map_overall / hungerford_map_town)
```

When we created the `hungerford_map_overall` object in the previous section, we
gave the map title a negative border using the `plot.title` argument to the
`theme()` function. This had the effect of moving the title downwards onto the
map to save space, since the top-left corner of the map was empty. We also added
a scale bar, since when you present two related maps of different scales next to 
one another, it is useful to show the scales of both maps to help readers relate
them to one another.

When we present two maps together and one of them shows an area that includes
the area covered by the other one, it is also helpful to readers to show the
area of the larger-scale map on the smaller-scale map. Since the area covered by
the Hungerford town map is determined by a buffered bounding box around the
shooting locations, we can add this same area to the overall shootings map. To
do this, we convert the bounding box of the town shootings we stored as
`hungerford_town_bbox` to an SF object using the `st_as_sfc()` function.

We will also add a label explaining what the box shows using the `annotate()`
function from `ggplot2`. `annotate()` acts like the `geom_` family of functions,
except that we can specify the values of aesthetics like `x` and `y` directly
as arguments, rather than by pointing to columns in a dataset.

```{r multiple-exercise3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=20, fig.asp=1}
hungerford_map_overall2 <- hungerford_map_overall + 
  geom_sf(
    data = st_as_sfc(hungerford_town_bbox), 
    inherit.aes = FALSE, 
    fill = NA
  ) +
  annotate(
    geom = "label", 
    x = pluck(hungerford_town_bbox, "xmin"), 
    y = pluck(hungerford_town_bbox, "ymin"),
    label = "area covered\nby map below",
    hjust = 1,
    label.size = NA,
    lineheight = 0.9,
    size = 2.5,
    vjust = 1
  )

(hungerford_map_overall2 / hungerford_map_town)
```

We can add shared titles and captions to combined maps created with `patchwork`
using the `plot_annotation()` function. This function has a `theme` argument,
which we can use to change the appearance of the shared title and caption just
as we use `theme()` to change the appearance of elements on single maps.

```{r multiple-exercise4, exercise=TRUE, fig.asp=1}
(hungerford_map_overall2 / hungerford_map_town) + plot_annotation(
  title = "Shootings during the Hungerford massacre",
  caption = "data from the official report into the shootings",
  theme = theme(
    plot.caption = element_text(colour = "grey40"),
    plot.title = element_text(colour = "grey50", face = "bold", size = 16)
  )
)
```

There are various other improvements that we could make to this map based on the
mapping skills we have already learned during this course. For example, we could
add the locations of buildings or particular facilities using data from 
OpenStreetMap. What information we choose to present on the map will depend on 
what information we think it is important to communicate to our audience.


## Geographic profiling

Geographic profiling is a technique used to analyse serial crimes to predict the 
most-probable area in which the offender is based. This may be their home, or
another anchor point such as their place of work (if they typically offend
while travelling from work rather than from home).

Watch this video (you only need to watch the first three minutes) in which Kim 
Rossmo, who developed the techniques of geographic profiling, explain what 
geographic profiling is used for and how it works. Kim talks about using the 
software Rigel to carry out geographic profiling, but we will do it in R.

![](https://youtu.be/fXbCR0nGj_E)

While geographic profiling cannot solve a crime, it can help police prioritise
different pieces of information. For example, if two different people in 
different parts of a city contacted police as the result of a witness appeal,
both saying they suspected a neighbour might be the offender, police could use
a geographic profile to decide which tip to follow up more urgently.

Geographic profiling will become more effective as the number of crimes in the 
series goes up -- geographic profiling is only likely to be useful when a series 
contains at least five crimes. 
When we use geographic profiling it is important to remember that it is only
likely to be accurate if certain assumptions about the crime series are true.
Specifically, geographic profiling assumes that:

  1. every crime believed to be part of the series was actually committed by the
     same offender or group of offenders (i.e. the series doesn't contain any
     crimes that were actually committed by someone else),
  2. all (or at least most of) the crimes committed by the offender are known
     about (i.e. there are no missing crimes),
  3. the offender does not 'commute' into an area to commit their offences,
  4. the offender's anchor point has not moved during the series (e.g. if they
     moved home or changed jobs), and
  5. the distribution of suitable targets is not highly concentrated in a 
     particular place (if so, the profile will reflect the distribution of 
     targets more than the movement patterns of the offender).

Unfortunately, it is often difficult to know for sure if these assumptions are
true in any particular case. For example, if multiple separate offenders are
committing similar crimes in an area, police may not know which crimes were
committed by which offender unless one is caught and confesses. The risk of
mis-attribution of cases to particular crime series can be reduced by
good-quality investigation of each offence, since evidence such as DNA or video
from CCTV surveillance cameras can help attribute particular crimes to
particular offenders with greater certainty.

One part of the process of geographic profiling is creating a *geo-profile* or 
*jeopardy surface*, which shows the relative probabilities of an offender's 
anchor point being in a particular place. A geo-profile is created by placing a 
grid over the area covered by the locations of crimes suspected to be part of 
the series and then (for each cell in the grid) calculating the weighted distance
from each crime to that cell. Just as with kernel density estimation, there are
different methods of weighting the distances between each cell and each crime.
We will use the *negative exponential profile* method, which is appropriate for
places where streets are not aligned to a grid system (as is commonly the case
in European countries).

We can calculate geo-profiles in R using the 
[`rgeoprofile` package](https://github.com/JSSpaulding/rgeoprofile). This 
package contains functions to calculate geo-profiles using several different
weighting methods, with the negative exponential method available in the 
`neg_exp_profile()` function.
`neg_exp_profile()` calculates a score for each cell in a grid covering the 
bounding box of the offence locations. Higher scores indicate a greater 
probability that the offender's anchor point is in that cell.

We will calculate a geo-profile for the canal murders introduced at the start of
this tutorial. `neg_exp_profile()` bases the profiles on the latitude and 
longitude of each offence location (or, in this case, the locations where the 
bodies were found) passed as separate vectors to the `lat` and `lon` arguments.
There are two methods available within the `neg_exp_profile()` function, of 
which we will use the `CrimeStat` method.

```{r}
canal_murders %>% 
  knitr::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

<!--
Research into offender decision making has often shown that people typically do
not offend at places very close to their home because they perceived that there
is an increased risk of being caught in an area where they are more likely to be
recognised. This finding is often incorporated into geographic profiling by
specifying a *buffer zone* around each crime within which the offender is 
unlikely to live (since if they did live there they would have been unlikely to
offend so close to home). Although we cannot know for sure what an unknown 
offender considers to be 'too close' to home to offend, we will specify that our
geo-profile include a buffer using the `buffer = TRUE` argument.
-->

Calculating a geo-profile can take several minutes, so it is possible that this
next code block will not be able to run within the time limit for running R code
within tutorials. If you see an error saying 
`Your code ran longer than the permitted timelimit for this exercise` or 
`reached elapsed time limit`, you can continue with the rest of the tutorial as
usual.

```{r geo-exercise1, exercise=TRUE}
library(rgeoprofile)

canal_geoprofile <- neg_exp_profile(
  lat = pull(canal_murders, "latitude"),
  lon = pull(canal_murders, "longitude"),
  method = "CrimeStat"
)
```

`neg_exp_profile()` produces a data frame containing the latitude and longitude 
of each cell in the grid covering the bounding box of the offence locations, 
together with a `sums` column containing the relative score for that cell. To 
display the scores on a map we will first download a base map based on the
locations at which the bodies were discovered, then add a layer for the
geo-profile. 

Since the data frame produced by `neg_exp_profile()` function contains the
latitudes and longitudes for the centre of each grid cell, we will use the
`geom_contour_filled()` function that is designed to summarise data consisting
of an `x` and `y` co-ordinate together with a `z` value (in this case, `sums`)
representing the thing we are interested in. As with the KDE maps we have
produced previously, the exact values in the `sums` column are less important
than knowing that higher values indicate higher probabilities, so we will
replace the default legend labels with ones of our own.

For reference, we will add the locations at which the bodies were discovered to
the map. Since bodies were found at some locations more than once, this brings
back the problem of overlapping points that we have discussed in earlier
tutorials. To deal with this here, we will use the `position_jitter()` helper
function to move the crime locations very slightly so that they do not overlap.
How far to move the points (using the `width` and `height` arguments) is
probably best determined by trial and error. Jittering points introduces some
minor inaccuracy into the map, but at this map scale this is unlikely to matter,
especially since some of the bodies were found in large open areas and so the
recorded locations are likely to be approximate.

```{r geo-exercise2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=35, fig.asp=1}
canal_murders_basemap <- canal_murders %>% 
  st_transform(25832) %>% 
  st_buffer(2000) %>% 
  st_transform(4326) %>% 
  st_bbox() %>% 
  set_names(c("left", "bottom", "right", "top")) %>%
  get_stamenmap()

ggmap(canal_murders_basemap) +
  geom_contour_filled(
    aes(x = lons, y = lats, z = sums), 
    data = canal_geoprofile, 
    inherit.aes = FALSE,
    alpha = 0.75,
    bins = 16
  ) +
  # Add the body locations
  geom_point(
    aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), 
    data = canal_murders, 
    inherit.aes = FALSE, 
    position = position_jitter(width = 0.003, height = 0.003),
    shape = 22
  ) +
  # Use a viridis scale, which highlights the highest probability locations
  scale_fill_viridis_d(
    labels = c("lower", rep("", times = 13), "higher"),
    direction = 1,
    guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)
  ) +
  coord_sf(crs = 4326) +
  labs(fill = "probability of\noffender\nanchor point") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.key.height = unit(6, "pt"))
```

We can see from this geo-profile that the areas with the highest probability of
containing the offender's anchor point are in the bottom-left of the map (about
half-way between the cities of Darmstadt and Frankfurt). This information could
be very useful for detectives who need to prioritise different lines of enquiry
or different potential suspects.

We can also see that there is one point in the top-left of the map that is far 
away from all the other locations. It may be worth checking the strength of the 
evidence that led each point to be included in the crime series. Is the evidence 
for including this distant point as strong as for the other points?

Geographic profiling cannot tell you who committed a crime, or exactly where an
offender is based. What it can do is provide information that can be combined
with other sources to help make decisions that can help an investigation into a
crime series.


<!--
## Plotting the journey to crime

For many crimes (especially predatory crimes), offenders must travel to and from 
the location of the offence. Investigators will sometimes know some points along
this journey, but not the whole route. For example, detectives investigating a
kidnapping murder may know where the victim was taken from and where the body 
was found, but not know where the offender or victim were between those points.
For a more-common crime such as car theft, police may know where a car was 
stolen from and where it was recovered, but not have any information about where
it was between those times.

When investigating crimes involving travel between points, it will often be 
useful to work out the route taken between two points. For example, establishing
a possible route might make it possible to check CCTV cameras, analyse toll-road 
records or seek witnesses along the way. A potential route might also allow an
analyst to consider whether any other crimes along that route might be part of a
crime series. If pairs of points are known for multiple crimes that are believed
to be a linked series, it is possible that looking for overlapping parts of the 
routes between pairs of points might help identify the offender's anchor point.

We can plot the fastest route between two locations on foot or in a vehicle 
using tools that were designed for transport planning. The 
[`stplanr` package](https://docs.ropensci.org/stplanr/) uses data from the
OpenStreetMap routing service to work out the fastest route between two points.
-->



## In summary

a sequence of events on a map and on using the locations of crimes to assist in
identifying an offender's anchor point using geographic profiling. We have also
learned how to combine maps using the `patchwork` package.
