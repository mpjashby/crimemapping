# crimemapping 0.5.2

* Fixed a problem in which some users were unable to access objects within 
  tutorial 11 that relied on daisy-chaining of learnr chunks via the 
  exercise.setup chunk option, so moved the necessary objects into the setup
  chunk.

# crimemapping 0.5.1

* Fixed a mistake in the 'Using data about places' tutorial that caused an error
  when trying to unzip a file to a specific directory.

# crimemapping 0.5.0

* Added content for Week 6, including tutorials on 'Using data about places' and
  'Mapping hotspots' as well as data for various offences in Nottingham and
  personal robberies in Toronto.
* Began roll-out of new UCL theme for tutorials.
* Began to speed up tutorial loading by pre-processing code that produces static 
  images in tutorials so that it only needs to be run at run-time if the 
  relevant static image is not present.
* Added data for anti-social behaviour in Northumbria.
* Added installation instructions to README.


# crimemapping 0.4.0

* Added content for Week 4, including tutorials on 'Handling bugs in your code'

  in the United Kingdom, murders in Uttar Pradesh and stalking in Queensland.
* Removed need for user to download Natural Earth data when launching the 
  'Wrangling data' tutorial if the resulting map already exists as an image file
  (which it should do).
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.


# crimemapping 0.3.0

* Added content for Week 3, including tutorials on 'Code with style' and 'Giving
